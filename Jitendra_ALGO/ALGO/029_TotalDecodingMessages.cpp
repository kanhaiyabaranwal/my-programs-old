A top secret message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers 
using the following mapping:
'A' -> 1 , 'B' -> 2 ... 'Z' -> 26
You are an FBI agent. You have to determine the total number of ways that message
can be decoded. 
Note: An empty digit sequence is considered to have one decoding. 
It may be assumed that the input contains valid digits from 0 to 9 
and If there are leading 0’s, extra trailing 0’s and two or more consecutive 0’s 
then it is an invalid string.
Example :
Given encoded message "123",  it could be decoded as "ABC" (1 2 3) or 
"LC" (12 3) or "AW"(1 23). So total ways are 3
